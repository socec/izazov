Tribute to my first serious programming project from high school

These are the original files from my first serious computer program. I'm proud of it now because it was created with basic programming knowledge. It also makes me laugh now to see it's ugly programming style.  
It was written in Turbo Pascal and uses graphics. Original source (.pas) is provided together with prebuilt executable (.exe) and graphics units. Use DOSBox to run the executable on modern systems (http://www.dosbox.com).  
Building your own version from source is possible with Turbo Pascal or Free Pascal, although graphics related problems might occur.
